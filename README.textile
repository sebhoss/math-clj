p. Common math functions for Clojure-based projects.

h2. Usage

p. The library offers a JDK-, JavaScript- and a pure Clojure-based implementations. Depending on your target platform chose the appropriate dependency and @:require@ both the @com.github.sebhoss.math-protocols@ and @com.github.sebhoss.math@ namespace.

p. The following matrix shows which vars are available on which platform:
